== Description ==

Minimalistic accordion plugin. Text expander plugin. Just like popcorn. Click and pop.

Use it to toggle (show/hide) blocks of text, by inserting a simple shortcode:

`[wpex more="Read more" less="Read less"]hidden text[/wpex]`

Replace "Read more" and "Read less" with your desired text. Use `.wpex-link` class to style the links.

Use a different class to style the links by using a custom class:

`[wpex class="wpex-link" more="Read more" less="Read less"]hidden text[/wpex]`

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin via the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. Create and publish a new page and add this shortcode: `[wpex more="Read more" less="Read less"]hidden text[/wpex]`
4. If you upgraded from 0.1.x change your `[wpex Read more]` to `[wpex more="Read more" less="Read less"]`
